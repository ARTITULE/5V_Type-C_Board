# 5V Type-C Board
This is a PCB board that can be used to supply 5 V to other devices.

It works with both Type-A to Type-C (aka QC chargers) and Type-C to Type-C (aka PD chargers).
Also, unlike many cheap AliExpress boards, it supports its functionality when plugged in both ways.

There is an LED on the board to show if the board is receiving power.

## Ordering 
The board can be ordered using many PCB services, but if you would like to have it assembled, you can order an assembled version from JLCPCB (they did not sponsor this, I promise).

Alternatively, you can solder the board yourself. The components used are 0805 size, so it is still solderable by hand.

If you go with the assembled version, the BOM and positioning files are attached.
