# 5V Type-C Board
This is a pcb board that can be used to supply 5v to other devices.

It works with both Type-A to Type-C (aka QC chargers) and Type-C to Type-C (aka PD chargers).
Also unlike many cheap aliexpress boards it supports its functuonality when pluged in both ways.

There is a LED on the board to show is the board reciewing power.

## Ordering 
The board can be orderd using many pcb services but if you whould like to have it assembled you can order a assembled version from JLCPCB (they did not sponsor this i promise).

Aulternatively you can solder the board yourself the components used are 0805 size so it is still solderable by hand.

If you go with the assembled wersion the BOM and Positioning files are attached.
